19:-Consider the following code snippet.

if (aNumber >= 0)
    if (aNumber == 0)
        System.out.println("first string");
else System.out.println("second string");
System.out.println("third string");

a: What output do you think the code will produce if aNumber is 3?
Answer:- 
        If a number is 3  then the output will be the-
          second string
          third string
   

b: Write a test program containing the previous code snippet; make aNumber 3. What is the output of the program? Is it what you predicted? Explain why the output is what it is; in other words, what is the control flow for the code snippet?

The output of code after  aNumber is 3:
      second string
       third string

 It is the example of nested if else. The first if statement is aNumber>=0 that means 3 is greater than equal to 0. Thus second string is displayed 
And the second if statement is fails because aNuber==0 3 is not equal to 0.
Last println completely outside of any if statement, so it always gets executed, and thus third string is always displayed. 


c-
if (aNumber >= 0)
    if (aNumber == 0)
        System.out.println("first string");
    else
        System.out.println("second string");

System.out.println("third string");



d:-

public class jpr19
  {
      public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		int aNumber=3;
   if (aNumber>= 0)
    if(aNumber== 0)
        System.out.println("first string");
    else
        System.out.println("second string");

 System.out.println("third string");
}
}
