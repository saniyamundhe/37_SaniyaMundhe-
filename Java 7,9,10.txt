7 a:- Answer- 
         i is 11, and n is 0.

7b:-Answer
       : i is 11, and n is 1.
      When we use postfix increment operator it will first increment value of i i.e 11 and then 11% 5 = 1 so 1  will be stored in n.
      In other case of prefix operator it will perform 10%5 first and store 0 in n i.e n=0


9 Answer:-

        because the prefix version  ++ evaluates to the incremented value. The next line, System.out.println(i++); evaluates to the current value 6, then increments by one.


10 Answer:-
        aValue = 8933.234; // assignment statement aValue is assigned by value 8933.234 
        aValue++; // increment statement  
        System.out.println("Hello World!"); // method invocation statement here the simply print the statement Hello world! 
        Bicycle myBike = new Bicycle(); // object creation statement
